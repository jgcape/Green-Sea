# Green-Sea
A small Raiden style arcade game created using C# and Splashkit. This game uses the dotnet platform, which must be installed on your system to run the game.


--Instructions--

1. Copy the repository to a folder of your choice.

2. Navigate to the folder from a terminal.

3. Run the program using the command: dotnet run

4. Enjoy!


--Controls--

1. Arrow keys - player character movement. 
2. v key - launches a bubble projectile.
3. b key - drops an urchin bomb. 

--Power Ups--

1. The goldfish add a forcefield to the player, enabling you to be hit once without dying. This effect stacks twice.
2. The urchins give you one use of the urchin bomb, which clears the screen of enemies. You can hold up to 3 urchin bombs.

Note: The in-game controls are also listed in the in-game readme file, which is the button labelled '?' on the home screen.
